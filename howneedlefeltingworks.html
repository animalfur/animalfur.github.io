<h2><strong>How Needlefelting Works</strong></h2>
<p>How does needle felting work? All you can see while doing it is the needle poking the wool and the wool compressing. But on a <br>
microscopic scale, wool has a lot of little scales on it. Felting needles have tiny notches in them that pull wool down, but not <br>
back up. When you poke the wool with the felting needle, the wool fiber is pulled down, and the scales lock <br>
together. This is why the wool gets harder as you poke it more. On an industrial scale, wool goes through large machines <br>
with thousands of felting needles that poke the wool relentlessly. That felts wool extremely efficiently, and that is how <br>
many felting companies make money. 
</p>
<p>Needle felting is a simple hobby with a long history of animal fur and science behind the mechanics of how it works. It is almost 8000 <br>
years old, more than 20 times the age of America. It is amazing in its simplicity. Other than felting, people had very strange <br>
beliefs in animal fur. The way it works must have taken years for ancient people to understand and implement. <br>
Felting is a very fascinating craft.
