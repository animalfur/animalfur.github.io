<h2><strong>Ancient Uses for Animal Fur</strong></h2>

<p>Other than felting, people had many strange uses for animal fur a long time ago. For example, some people thought that wearing <br>
animal fur would give them a trait from that animal. A hunter might wear a lion's coat because he wanted to be stronger <br>
or braver. Also, people thought that in their dreams, they actually became their animal and spoke to others of that <br>
species. But this faith in fur was not a good thing. Soon, a law was passed that lower-class women, <br>
like workers, could only wear fur of foxes, otters, or the fur of small burrowing animals. Higher-class women could wear <br>
any fur they wanted, and rich people would often mortgage huge estates or patches of land to buy a fur coat for <br>
their wife. Hunters would hunt small animals, like foxes, or more impressive ones, like a polar bear or a tiger. <br>
Either way, they could make a lot of money. But hunters had one large problem. If there was a small hole or cut, <br>
or even a small amount of blood, the price would lower for that particular piece. As a result, very experienced hunters learned to kill an animal <br>
without touching its fur. That was one interesting use for animal fur a long time ago - as a coat.
</p>
<p>It is possible to use any animal fiber to felt. Wool is the best because it is dense and hardens easily, but you can use dog hair <br>
as well. Since it is finer, it takes longer, but it works in the end. For part of my core project, I felt dog hair. <br>
