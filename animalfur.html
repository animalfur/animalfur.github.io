<h1><strong>Core Project Explanation</strong></h1>
<div class="a">
<p>My name is Gavin, and this page explains my Core Project, a semester-long project where you learn and make something.<br>
My core projet has two parts: needlefelting and coding HTML. This website includes pictures of felted animals, <br>
and an essay about needlefelting. </p>
<p>The reason that I chose this Core Project is that I was interested in coding, and we had a lot of dog fur laying around the house. <br>
I also wanted to make somethng outside of the website, so I thought of needlefelting. My goals for the project are to make a family <br>
of penguins and code a website using HTML.
</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p>
My most important piece of research is, of course, how to needle felt. To needle felt, you use a needle with barbs that pull wool down <br>
but not up. To use this needle, you poke the wool over and over, and gradually, the wool will be forced down and not get pulled back up. <br>
Since the wool stuck near the center, it gets more and more compressed, and the shape you want to make slowly gets harder and more defined. This makes <br>
the wool harder and your project more refined. I used this research in all of my creations, as without this research, I could not have done <br>
any of the felting. This is my first piece of research I used in my project. 
</p>
<p>
My second most important part of research is how to code HTML. To learn this, I went to the library and checked out a book on it, <em>HTML5 In <br>Easy Steps.</em>
It taught me all of the commands I needed to code this website, as well as the resources that I needed to write the code.<br>
The most important commands I used were the command to make a paragraph, the commands to style the background and format the text. These <br>
were important because formatting the text makes it easier to present, and the command to make a paragraph was very important, as at least 3/4 of my <br>
website is paragraphs.
</p>

<p>Another important piece of research was the research about adding links to the website.. The command is "a href="" and then your link. I put links onto <br>
my website and made them go to other parts of the website. This was important because if I did not know this function, I would have one giant web <br>
page that would be long and boring. This function makes my web page more presentable and makes it look better.</p>

<p>Also, I needed to know how to clean the dog hair, as my project revolves around dog hair. To clean the dog hair, you have to put it in a mixture of <br>
dish soap and water, and throughly rinse it out. Washing the dog hair is important, because otherwise whatever would be disgusting and full of <br>
germs. It also makes the dog hair better to felt, because you cannot felt with a needle that has dirt in it. For these reasons, the knowledge of cleaning the dog <br>
hair was very important to do this project.</p>

<p>Finally, knowing how to publish a Google Photo and putting it onto the website was very important. I had a lot of trouble publishing it at first, and <br>
when I tried to put them on, an X came up. This is because my website could not get the picture. Eventually, I figured it out, and now my pictures are on my website. <br>
My videos were even harder, and they could not be put onto the website at all. Instead, I made buttons with links to my videos, and it opens a new tab when you click on them. <br>
Figuring out how to upload media onto the website was another very important piece of research that helped my website.</p>

<h4>Interview</h4>
<p>
These are some questions I asked my interviewee, Claire Impens. Claire Impens is a felting instructor at thetinthimble.com. She has 15 years of felting experience.<br>
What were some early problems you had when you started felting?<br>
She said that her creations were too fuzzy and not smooth enough.<br>
What advice do you have that could help my felting creations?<br>
She told me to experiment in size and try my own ideas.<br>
What makes you an expert at felting? Do you have classes for kids?<br>
She has 15 years of felting experience, and she has classes for all ages.<br>
How do you prevent accidents?<br>
She says to slow down and give the craft your full attention.<br>
Do you have a favorite kit or brand of needles?<br>
She likes felting needles from her buisness, as well as roving from livingfelt.com.<br>
Do you think felting dog hair could work?<br>
She said yes, any textile fur will work.
</p>
<h4>Problems I had</h4>
<p>One challenge I faced was putting photos on my website. At first, I didn't even know how to publish a photo, and I kept trying to find help. <br>
Eventually, I found a website that turned links into pictures on the website, and that is how I got over the challenge.<br>
One thing that I think I did well is persevering in taking two hours to felt something and being patient, since I could not tell if I was making <br>
progress. Also, I think I did well figuring out how to put certain things on the website, like putting on text and changing the background. <br>
These were some challenges and goals that I succeeded in.</p>
<h4>What I learned</h4>
<p>From this project, I learned to persevere, as needlefelting and coding takes a very long time and takes a lot of patience. This project also <br>
taught me how to write HTML and how to needlefelt.</p>
